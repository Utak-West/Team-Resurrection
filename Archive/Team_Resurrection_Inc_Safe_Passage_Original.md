## Executive Summary

Team Resurrection Inc. respectfully submits this proposal for $520,000 to implement the "Safe Passage Program," a comprehensive school zone safety initiative that provides coordinated violence prevention and safety services in the immediate vicinity of Westside High School and Central High School in Newark's West Ward. Under the experienced leadership of Program Director Malika McCall, this initiative represents an innovative approach to community-based violence prevention that creates safe corridors for students while building community capacity for ongoing safety and violence prevention.

The Safe Passage Program addresses the critical need for enhanced safety measures in school zones where students are particularly vulnerable to violence exposure and involvement. Our comprehensive approach includes deployment of trained Safe Passage workers at strategic corner locations surrounding both target schools, creating a coordinated safety network that provides both immediate protection and ongoing violence prevention services for students, families, and community members.

The program's operational model centers on having dedicated Safe Passage workers positioned at each corner of the two designated school zones, ensuring comprehensive coverage and coordinated response capabilities that address both immediate safety concerns and longer-term violence prevention goals. These workers are equipped with professional communication equipment, identification materials, and uniforms that establish their presence and authority while building positive relationships with students and community members.

Our approach recognizes that effective school zone safety requires more than just physical presence, incorporating comprehensive training for all Safe Passage workers in conflict de-escalation, crisis intervention, youth engagement, and community organizing that enables them to serve as positive role models and resources for students while addressing safety concerns. The program also includes regular team-building and professional development activities that maintain staff morale and effectiveness while building sustainable capacity for ongoing programming.

The Safe Passage Program builds upon Team Resurrection's proven track record of community-based violence prevention while addressing the specific challenges and opportunities presented by school zone safety programming. Our experience with credible messenger approaches, community organizing, and youth engagement provides the foundation for effective implementation of school zone safety programming that creates both immediate safety improvements and long-term community transformation.

This proposal represents a strategic investment in evidence-based school zone safety programming that leverages community relationships, professional training, and coordinated deployment strategies to create measurable improvements in student safety while building community capacity for ongoing violence prevention and community development.
