## Executive Summary

Team Resurrection Inc. respectfully submits this proposal for $520,000 to implement the "Safe Passage Program," a comprehensive school zone safety initiative that provides coordinated violence prevention and safety services in the immediate vicinity of Westside High School and Central High School in Newark's West Ward.

## Statement of Need

### Community Context

Newark's West Ward faces significant challenges related to youth violence and community safety, particularly in areas surrounding schools where students are most vulnerable during transition times. Recent data indicates that school zones experience heightened incidents of violence, creating an environment where students, families, and community members feel unsafe and where educational outcomes are negatively impacted by safety concerns.

The intersection of poverty, limited economic opportunities, and historical disinvestment has created conditions where violence becomes normalized and where young people lack positive role models and safe spaces for development. Students attending Westside High School and Central High School navigate daily safety concerns that impact their ability to focus on education and positive development.

### Target Population

**Primary Beneficiaries:** 2,600+ students attending Westside High School and Central High School
**Secondary Beneficiaries:** Families, community members, and local businesses in the school zone areas
**Geographic Focus:** Newark's West Ward, specifically the immediate vicinity of both target schools

- **Community Concerns:** Resident reports of safety concerns and requests for increased protection
- **Educational Impact:** Attendance and academic performance affected by safety concerns
