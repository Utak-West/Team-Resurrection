    <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
    <p>Team Resurrection Inc. respectfully submits this proposal for $425,000 to implement a comprehensive Youth Mentorship Program that provides intensive, relationship-based youth development services with a comprehensive family systems approach. Under the experienced leadership of Program Director Malika McCall, this initiative represents an innovative approach to youth development that addresses individual, family, and community factors contributing to positive youth outcomes.</p>

    <p>The Youth Mentorship Program serves 125 youth participants and their families through a six-site community hub model that provides daily programming, comprehensive meal services, and specialized support for Juvenile Justice Commission (JJC) participants. Our approach recognizes that sustainable youth development requires addressing family dynamics, basic needs, and community conditions while building strong mentoring relationships and providing evidence-based interventions.</p>

    <h2>Statement of Need</h2>

    <h3>Community Context</h3>
    <p>Newark's West Ward faces significant challenges related to youth development, with high rates of poverty, limited educational opportunities, and exposure to violence creating barriers to positive youth outcomes. Young people in this community often lack access to consistent mentoring, safe spaces for development, and comprehensive support services that address both individual and family needs.</p>

    <p>The intersection of economic hardship, family instability, and community violence creates conditions where young people are at high risk for negative outcomes including school failure, substance abuse, and involvement with the juvenile justice system. Traditional youth programming often fails to address the complex, interconnected factors that influence youth development, necessitating a comprehensive approach that addresses individual, family, and community needs.</p>

    <h3>Target Population</h3>
