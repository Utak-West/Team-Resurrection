## Statement of Need

### Community Context

Newark's West Ward faces significant challenges related to youth development, with high rates of poverty, limited educational opportunities, and exposure to violence creating barriers to positive youth outcomes. Young people in this community often lack access to consistent mentoring, safe spaces for development, and comprehensive support services that address both individual and family needs.

The intersection of economic hardship, family instability, and community violence creates conditions where young people are at high risk for negative outcomes including school failure, substance abuse, and involvement with the juvenile justice system. Traditional youth programming often fails to address the complex, interconnected factors that influence youth development, necessitating a comprehensive approach that addresses individual, family, and community needs.

### Target Population

**Primary Participants:** 125 youth aged 14-24 in Newark's West Ward
**Specialized Population:** Juvenile Justice Commission (JJC) participants requiring intensive support
**Family Integration:** Parents, guardians, and family members of youth participants
**Geographic Focus:** Six strategically located community sites throughout Newark's West Ward

### Evidence of Need

- **Educational Challenges:** High dropout rates and low academic achievement among target population
- **Justice Involvement:** Significant number of youth involved with juvenile justice system
- **Family Stress:** Economic hardship and family instability affecting youth development
- **Limited Resources:** Lack of comprehensive, relationship-based youth programming in the community
